## assets folders

Asset folder contains only common diffs of entity files.
This makes it possible to edit and update a large number of entity files.

- Prepare a vanilla entities folder <https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples>
- Sort by format version in JDD
  - Open [JDD](https://mcbeeringi.github.io/apps/mc/jdd.html)
  - Select the prepared entities folder
  - Press the run button without changing the text field.
- Combine the files in the assets folder with the assets files in JDSM for each sorted version
  - Open [JDSM](https://mcbeeringi.github.io/apps/mc/jdsm.html)
  - Select the folder named with the version number
  - Paste the contents of the assets file with the same version number into the insert text field
  - Press the run button
